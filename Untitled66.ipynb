    "Q1. The Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the ensemble learning family. It is used for regression tasks and is an extension of the Random Forest algorithm. It combines multiple decision trees to make predictions for regression problems, such as predicting numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. The Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through two main mechanisms:\n",
    "   - **Bootstrapping**: It creates multiple subsets of the training data by randomly sampling with replacement. Each decision tree in the ensemble is trained on a different subset of data, introducing diversity and reducing the chance of any single tree overfitting.\n",
    "   - **Averaging**: Instead of relying on a single decision tree's prediction, the Random Forest Regressor aggregates predictions from multiple trees. Averaging these predictions helps smooth out individual tree's errors, reducing noise and overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. The Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by averaging (for regression tasks) or using a majority vote (for classification tasks). In regression, the final prediction is typically the mean (average) of the predictions made by individual trees in the forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Common hyperparameters of the Random Forest Regressor include:\n",
    "   - Number of trees in the forest (n_estimators).\n",
    "   - Maximum depth of each decision tree (max_depth).\n",
    "   - Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (min_samples_split).\n",
    "   - Minimum number of samples required to be a leaf node (min_samples_leaf).\n",
    "   - Maximum number of features to consider for the best split (max_features).\n",
    "   - Bootstrap sampling strategy (bootstrap).\n",
    "   - Random seed for reproducibility (random_state).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. The main differences between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor are:\n",
    "   - Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees, whereas Decision Tree Regressor is a single decision tree.\n",
    "   - Random Forest Regressor is less prone to overfitting due to its ensemble nature and the use of bootstrapping and averaging.\n",
    "   - Decision Tree Regressor can easily overfit to the training data, whereas Random Forest Regressor provides better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Advantages of Random Forest Regressor:\n",
    "   - Reduced risk of overfitting.\n",
    "   - Good performance on a wide range of regression problems.\n",
    "   - Robust to noisy data and outliers.\n",
    "   - Can handle both numerical and categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Disadvantages:\n",
    "   - Less interpretable than a single decision tree.\n",
    "   - May not perform as well as more advanced ensemble methods on certain complex tasks.\n",
    "   - Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. The output of a Random Forest Regressor is a single numerical prediction for each input example. For regression tasks, this prediction represents the estimated numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. While Random Forest is primarily designed for regression and can predict numerical values, it can also be used for classification tasks by using the Random Forest Classifier variant. The key difference is that the Classifier variant is designed specifically for classification, and it provides class labels or class probabilities as output instead of numerical predictions."
